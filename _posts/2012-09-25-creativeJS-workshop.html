<p>Mind = Blown.</p>

<p>Finished a two day workshop; CreativeJS for non&ndash;coders by Seb Lee&ndash;Delisle. Well, I&rsquo;d reckon some basic knowledge of Javascript is advisable but Seb explains things pretty well with his visual aids.</p>

<p>The workshop is an introduction to HTML5 Canvas; learning the basics of creating shapes, colours, animations, particles, faking physics and such (with some cheating). We created a single&ndash;player Pong game by midday of the second day and a particle generator by the end of the workshop! Seb broke down the problems into tiny chunks and gave us small exercises of solving them; making the problem a lot less intimidating.</p>

<p>Good stuff!</p>

<p>This is what I created within the two days:</p>
