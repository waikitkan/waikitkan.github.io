title: Another update

<p>So I&rsquo;ve updated my site again. This time. It&rsquo;s bare. Very. Bare. Firstly, let&rsquo;s talk a bit about the build.</p>

<p>Previously, I was using WordPress which I have now converted to using GitHub pages. The whole site is compiled with Jekyll and with Jekyll releasing it&rsquo;s 2.0 update only a week or two ago and now supporting native SASS, I have dumped Grunt for my personal website&mdash;though still use it in other things&mdash;and opted in for &ldquo;plain SASS&rdquo; without the frameworks or libraries. Posts are published through the Terminal and written in HTML&mdash;could&rsquo;ve done Markdown but just prefer HTML&mdash;my site feels so raw and minimal but without the functionality of just raw HTML. Win.</p>

<p>So why the switch?</p>

<p>WordPress was too much for me. 95% of features in WordPress I had never touched or I didn&rsquo;t understand/ felt the need to use. This also bring me back to the purpose of my site. Never quite knew what I wanted it to do. It wasn&rsquo;t a frequently updated blog; a couple posts a year at most, it wasn&rsquo;t a proper portfolio site; especially now that my focus is not in that area anymore, and what I had planned to do show&ndash;case&ndash;like posts revolving around cool CSS stuff similar to Codrops didn&rsquo;t work out either. Maybe it will now.</p>

<p>Anyway, keeping the setup very plain feels like I can do more with my site. Hope to bring more posts in the future!</p>
