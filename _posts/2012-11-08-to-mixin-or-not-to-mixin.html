title: To mixin or not to mixin
---


<p>I&rsquo;m still relatively new to using SASS so I may not know the reason why people prefer using this technique&hellip;</p>

<p>Seems like people (examples I&rsquo;ve seen so far) prefer using <code>@mixin</code> for a clearfix as to just having a clearfix class and using <code>@extend</code> instead.</p>

<p>An example would be this (taken from David Walsh&rsquo;s post on CSS-Tricks):</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
@mixin clear() {
  &::before,
  &::after {
    content: "\0020";
    display: block;
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
  
  &::after {
    clear: both;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>So, this would add the whole clearfix code to the class you are styling.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a bit excessive? Especially if you have a clearfixes all over the place (although you&rsquo;d probably avoid that as much as possible?)</p>

<p>Why not <code>@extend</code> the clearfix so it just adds the class to the clearfix code instead? It&rsquo;s less code output and it&rsquo;s probably not something you&rsquo;d change anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway, this has always been a thought of mine. Happy to be convinced otherwise but I&rsquo;m sticking with my way for the time being.</p>
