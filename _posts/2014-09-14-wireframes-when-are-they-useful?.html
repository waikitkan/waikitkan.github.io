<p>Wireframes have a well&ndash;known history of being part of a designers toolkit though I actually find they don&rsquo;t really provide much usefulness these days.</p>

<p>To illustrate why, Cennydd Bowles provides an excellent example in his <a href="http://www.cennydd.com/blog/why-i-dont-wireframe-much/" title="Why I Don&rsquo;t Wireframe Much">short and sweet &ldquo;article&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>They just feel too detached from the product you&rsquo;re designing for. Sure, the absence of visual design supposedly makes you focus more on the flow, but without the atmosphere (as Andy Clarke would put it) of a product, the wireframes are quite difficult to relate. Take usability testing for example. Showing wireframes versus showing screenshots to people. I don&rsquo;t doubt that screenshots will give a richer and more relatable experience to a product than wireframes.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re also not particularly quick to create &mdash; I prefer sketching as a method for speed &mdash; and when interaction is involved, I&rsquo;d rather hack a few screenshots and throw it in Invision and it would provide far better use than interactive wireframes alone. I used to do &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; prototyping with HTML and CSS but that also has its limits (that&rsquo;s also another story).</p>

<p>I still deal with wireframes from time to time, though I personally don&rsquo;t create them anymore for my process.</p>

<p>So when <em>are</em> they useful?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure they any advantages over other methods, but I know that other methods do provide some edge or another over wireframes.</p>
