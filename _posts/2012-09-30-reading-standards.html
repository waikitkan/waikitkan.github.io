<p>I&rsquo;ve used screens varying in size and resolution for work as well as for personal, but only recently when using my new MBA that I found generally reading stuff is fucking awful!</p>

<p>At work I use an iMac, the screen is fairly large and I&rsquo;m sitting fairly close to the screen; small text size seemed more forgiving. I have an iPad, and again when I use this I&rsquo;m fairly close to the screen and if I&rsquo;m far I normally just enlarge the site I&rsquo;m viewing. My previous Macbook (Pro) was a 15 inch one, the text on that seemed alright most of the time; I think my habit of being up close to the screen hid the fact that small sized text were hard to read. On occasions I&rsquo;ve really felt the strain of small text size.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve used my MBA for a week or so and I&rsquo;m finding general reading on the web so bad. Because of its screen size and the way I&rsquo;ve distanced my head away slightly from the screen I find text on some sites excruciatingly small. Tumblr for example, as I&rsquo;m writing this post on my MBA from a &ldquo;distance&rdquo; with a font size 13px, the text looks like alphabetical ants.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sound like an old man with an eye site problem but would it hurt to bump the text size a few pixels more as a default starting point? Why does paragraph text have to be so small?</p>

<p>What would be nice is to be able to browse the web without having to glue my eyes to the screen or manually bump up the text size.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read these before and have just read them again, they just make perfect sense. Here are the articles:</p>
